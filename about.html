  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We’re a Dutch startup smart clothing startup called ADAM & AOKI.</p>

    <p>So what do we mean by smart clothing? In short, we want to start making clothes that help people overcome everyday challenges. We feel that after thousands of years of practicality, it’s time for clothes to become as smart as we are.</p>

    <p>We plan to launch our first product in June via kickstarter. Our concept is a kids t-shirt that changes colour and warns users that they are in risk of getting sunburnt. The smart fabric in the t-shirt detects the presence dangerous UV light (the stuff that gives you sunburn) and will warn children and parents via a colour change in the sleeve. Our smart t-shirts also takes into account both your skin type and the time it takes you to burn.</p>

    <p>The first line of products won’t involve wearable tech. Whilst we do envisage that it will become part of our products in the future we feel that affordable technology at present isn’t advanced enough for it to be practical and durable enough for kids.</p>

    <h1 class="post-title">Story</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Back in the day I was a terrible teen, running riot. Football and females were pretty much my only interest, despite my parents best attempts to convince me it might be worth listening in school.</p>
    <p>Fortunately I was - and luckily still am - surrounded by some amazing people. My Grandparents, who lived through WWII, were always on hand valuable and candid advice. My brother Ben, who has more often that not been a voice of reason. And there was Gerry, one of my mother’s best friend and an unofficial mentor to me.</p>
    <p>I admired Gerry from the get go. A gentlemen, championing the fight against important causes like elder abuse and gay rights, and an unintended comedy genius. He was once at a ceremony with the then president Bill Clinton, and beamed as he told how he was close enough to take great photos. He couldn’t wait to get them developed. Only problem was he’d forgotten to put film in his camera.</p>
    <p>One of the first times I met him he parked his car in central London a spot that probably wasn’t meant to be parked in. Having stepped out the car, he walked over to the ticket machine. A few buttons later, the machine broke and spat out a bunch of pound coins but no ticket. He proclaimed that he thought “it would probably be ok” and proceeded to give me the change. The act typified his unselfishness.</p>
    <p>Sadly Gerry died of cancer in 2013. As a young man he had skin cancer (melanoma), developed from too much skin damage acquired from excessive sunbathing. Even though he beat skin cancer a young man, he died of lung cancer — which was caused by melanoma cancer cells that had remained from his first battle with cancer.</p>
    <p>ADAM & AOKI is for you Gerry.</p>
    <p> I hope you’d be proud.</p>
